<!-- GET STARTED -->

## üìò Get Started

The **Bookshelf** project is a simplified CRUD system, written in [C++][url_cpp],
developed as part of an academic assignment for the **Data Structure** course at the
[UniFatecie University Center][url_unifatecie].

<!-- PROPOSAL -->

## üìÑ Context of Academic Work

In short, you are a programmer who has accumulated various books throughout your life and
felt the need to create a program to manage them, registering all of them. After years,
you decided to donate some books and, for that, you needed to implement a system to
remove them from your system. Applying your knowledge about data structure, you start
programming.

> **Note:** This context was partially followed, since the need was just to program a
> simple system to remove data from a system. To take advantage of the repository, I
> decided to create a complete simple CRUD system.

<!-- BUILD APPLICATION -->

## ‚öôÔ∏è Build Application

This project was developed using the [CMake][url_cmake] ecosystem. No system-specific
headers were used, which means it can be easily ported to any operating system.

**If you are using [Microsoft Windows][url_windows], I recommend using
[Visual Studio][url_visual_studio].**
