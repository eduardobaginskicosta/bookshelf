<!-- GET STARTED -->

# üìò Get Started

**Bookshelf** is a simplified CRUD system written in [C++][url_cpp] as part of an
academic project for the **Data Structures** course at
[UniFatecie University][url_unifatecie].

The context is that you are a programmer who has accumulated a collection of books read throughout your life. However, you felt the need to create a program to manage them, registering all the books in the system. One day, you decided to start donating some of the books and had to implement the option to remove donated books from the system.

<!-- BUILD APPLICATION -->

# ‚öôÔ∏è Build Application

This project was developed using the [CMake][url_cmake] build environment. Currently, it
has pre-configuration for the [Microsoft Windows][url_windows] platform, but it does not
rely on specific system packages. **Therefore, it can be easily ported to other operating
systems**.
